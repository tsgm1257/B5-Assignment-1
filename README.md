# Understanding TypeScript: Code Quality and Enums

## âœ… How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

To answer how TypeScript improves code quality, we should first understand what TypeScript is. TypeScript is an object-oriented programming language that adds more features on top of JavaScript. It provides solutions where JavaScript is lacking.

For example, TypeScript introduces a rich type system. In JavaScript, you can't catch errors until you run the code. However, TypeScript helps you catch errors **before** you run your code. This means fewer bugs and better code quality.

By helping developers avoid errors early, enforcing consistent types, and providing helpful tooling, TypeScript improves both code quality and maintainabilityâ€”especially in large projects or teams.

## âœ… What is the use of enums in TypeScript? Provide an example of a numeric and string enum.

Enums are short for **enumerations**. Enums provide a way to give **names** to a set of constants. They are helpful when you have a fixed set of options like roles, days of the week, or statuses.

Enums make your code more readable than using raw numbers or strings. They prevent mistakes by allowing only valid predefined values. They're also easier to update or refactor from a single location.

### ðŸ”¹ Numeric Enum Example:

```ts
enum Direction {
  North,
  South,
  East,
  West
}

const move = Direction.North; // 0
